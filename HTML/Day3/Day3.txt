- Case sensitivity in HTML
-->

<!-- ==================== Section 1: HTML Headings ==================== -->
<!--
Definition:
HTML headings are used to define titles or subtitles on a webpage.
<h1> defines the most important heading, and <h6> the least important.
-->

<h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is Heading 6</h6>

<!--
✅ Task:
Create a webpage that displays all six heading levels with your name and course title.
-->


<!-- ==================== Section 2: HTML Paragraphs ==================== -->
<!--
Definition:
Paragraphs in HTML are defined using the <p> tag. They help separate blocks of text.
-->

<p>Hello! My name is John Doe.</p>
<p>I am learning Full Stack Web Development to become a skilled web developer.</p>

<!--
✅ Task:
Write a short self-introduction using 2 paragraphs.
-->


<!-- ==================== Section 3: The <pre> Tag ==================== -->
<!--
Definition:
The <pre> tag preserves both spaces and line breaks. 
Useful for poems, quotes, or code snippets.
-->

<pre>
  Roses are red,
    Violets are blue,
  I'm learning HTML,
    And so are you.
</pre>

<!--
✅ Task:
Use <pre> to write a short poem or quote with custom spacing.
-->


<!-- ==================== Section 4: HTML Links ==================== -->
<!--
Definition:
Links are created using the <a> tag.
The destination URL is set using the href attribute.
-->

<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a><br>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a><br>

<!--
✅ Task:
Create a list of 3 useful websites using <a> links.
-->


<!-- ==================== Section 5: Empty Elements ==================== -->
<!--
Definition:
Empty elements have no closing tag or content.
Examples include <br> for line breaks and <hr> for horizontal lines.
-->

<p>This is a paragraph with a<br>line break inside it.</p>
<hr>

<!--
✅ Task:
Write a paragraph, break a line using <br>, and separate two sections using <hr>.
-->


<!-- ==================== Section 6: HTML is Not Case Sensitive ==================== -->
<!--
Definition:
HTML tags are not case-sensitive. <P> and <p> work the same, 
but lowercase is standard practice in modern HTML.
-->

<P>This is a paragraph using capital P.</P>
<p>This is a paragraph using lowercase p.</p>
